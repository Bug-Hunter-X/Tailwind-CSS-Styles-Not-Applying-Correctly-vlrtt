# Tailwind CSS Styling Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS: styles not applying correctly.  The problem is likely due to an incorrect configuration or missing import. 

## Bug Description
The provided HTML uses Tailwind directives to style a button and container, but these directives have no effect. The button does not change color on hover, and other style elements are not reflected.

## Solution
The solution involves verifying that Tailwind CSS is properly configured and included in your project.  This typically includes:

1. **Correct Tailwind import:** Ensure that the Tailwind CSS directives are correctly imported into your JavaScript/HTML.
2. **PostCSS Setup:** Confirm that your project is correctly set up to use PostCSS, which is necessary for Tailwind's functionality.
3. **Configuration File:** Check your `tailwind.config.js` file to make sure it's properly configured. 
4. **Purge unused styles:** If your styles are not being applied because they are unused, make sure they are marked for inclusion by Tailwind's purging mechanisms.
